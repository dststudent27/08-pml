pml project

Participants in the Human Activity Recognition (HAR) Project were asked to perform various exercises correctly and incorrectly in 
5 different ways.  Using performance data collected from accelerometers fed by multiple quantified self movement devices, the goal 
of this project is to train, evaluate & test a model that could be used to predict the manner in which the participants performed 
the exercises.
